How to build Enterprise mobile apps that integrate with your Java EE backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Sébastien Blanc

Are you a Java developer and want to develop a mobile app that 
connects to a secured Java EE backend, but you don't know where 
to start? This session is tailored for you. This hands on session,
using a familiar development environment, goes step by step 
through building a complete mobile, hybrid, multiplatform application.

Starting from scratch, the tutorial takes you through building a 
simple Java EE application and, from there, scaffolding a 
mutliplatform mobile client by using Cordova. Finally we will 
show how to implement sending Push Notifications from the 
backend to be received on the mobile client.

This is an in-depth session in which the attendees will learn 
concretely, and without using hipster tools, how to enter 
the mobile world.

Successful Mobile Relationship management with Push Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Matthias Wessendorf

Business relationships take many forms like customers, partners 
or employees. For mobile application development, managing these 
relationships is crucial, since user interaction is an important 
part of a successful mobile app. Push notifications, a key feature 
of every mobile operating system, allow you to quickly reach your 
mobile users. In this session, we’ll discuss how to send targeted 
push messages from your Java backend including geolocation using 
Hibernate and BPM or rules based notifications to your mobile users.

The UnifiedPush Server is an open source solution providing an 
unified API for mobile operating systems, like iOS, Android or 
Windows Mobile. Join us to learn why implementing push notifications 
for several mobile platforms (each with its own proprietary API) 
can be easier than you might think, whether your Java backends 
are hosted in the cloud or inside your own datacenter.
