**Sprecher**: Ankit Chaudhary

Dilax provides a market-leading passenger counting solution for
the public transport sector (no we don’t sell clickers, we have
intelligent devices with sensors). When we have the information
about the number of people that were transported in a train/bus/tram,
we try to match the data with a scheduled journey or create a
heat map for further analytics and reporting.

I am Ankit Chaudhary, a Big Data Engineer in the Public Mobility
unit at DILAX and therefore strive to mitigate the challenges
that we face in our use cases regarding the data collected from
our counting systems.

In this talk I will present the architectural overview of a core
use case that our team worked on in the last months, i.e.
matching the counting data coming from the vehicles with the
schedules. I will describe the issues we were confronted with
and that led to the decision of revamping our solution, how we
achieved it by using stream processing (Apache Flink), document
store (Elasticsearch) and a microservices-based architecture and
what the advantages/disadvantages of the new stack are.

The talk will be in English and focus on the architectural aspect
of the solution only, it won’t deal with the core implementation
of the algorithm involved.
