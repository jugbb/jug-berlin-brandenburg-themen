OpenJDK at Alibaba
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Kingsum Chow, Sanhong Li

On Nov 11, 2017, Alibaba smashed its own online transaction record once
again, the peak number of transactions per second reached to 325,000,
85% above last year’s 175,000.

Most of all the application in Alibaba are written in Java, with more
than billion lines of Java code. We already built and deployed
customized OpenJDK with our specific changes for large-scale
eCommerce web applications, which are running on more than 100,000
servers. In this talk, we will discuss how we tailor the OpenJDK for
our needs and, we will go into the details of the improvements we
made based on OpenJDK.
