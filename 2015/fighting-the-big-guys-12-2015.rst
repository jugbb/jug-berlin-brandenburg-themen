Fighting the Big Guys - the history of an architecture

**Sprecher**: Gregor Zeitlinger, Ronnie

How trying to do a better product than Amazon, Google, and Apple is surprisingly hard.
The hosts tell the story of a group of daring people who created a platform for
ereading in 2007. Their original code base morphed from a desktop ebook management
tool into
txtr.com
a fully grown e-commerce platform selling books on phones, tablets,
ereaders and the web, in many languages, all over Europe. Unfortunately,
Amazon had also noticed that this was a good idea. Then Google noticed. Then Apple.

Keeping the code base afloat under the kind of pressure that resulted was
hard, but proved just about possible. When, in the end, the company had
to give up, the platform stood strong: Storecast bought the code base to
keep the platform running for JUKE! (a property of Media-Saturn), and
convinced some of the developers to stay on.
