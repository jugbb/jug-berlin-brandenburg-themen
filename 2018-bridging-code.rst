Bridging the Divide between Architecture and Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Chris Chedgey

Static diagrams on wikis and white-boards might capture the vision of architects, but they
don’t much help programmers to understand how the code they’re working on right now
fits into the architecture. Nor are the programmers warned when they violate the
diagrams as they forge changes, line-by-line. This is a huge problem – it
is ultimately individual lines of code that make or break an architecture;
and we know that a clean architecture will help teams develop a more flexible product,
with less complexity, less wasted effort, etc. Worse, without practical architectural
guidance, programmers wrestle with invisible structures that emerge from thousands
of inter-dependent lines of code. And being invisible, these structures become ever
more complex, coupled, and tangled. In fact, uncontrolled structure actively fights
against productive development. This talk shows how to rein in emergent code-base
structures and gradually transform them into a cogent, defined architecture.
You will see how...

* Visualizing the emergent structure makes a code-base easier to understand.
* Restructuring to remove tangles and reduce coupling makes the visualized code-base easier to work on.
* Specifying layering and dependency rules converts good structure into a
  controlled architecture that guides the team as the code-base evolves and grows.

A key ingredient is a live visualization, inside the IDE, of the detailed
code the programmer is working on, in the context of the overall architecture.
In short, you will learn how bridging the architect/programmer divide can convert
code-base structure from liability into an asset that actively works for development
productivity.
