Dr. James J. Hunt
~~~~~~
Dr. James J. Hunt is CEO and cofounder of aicas GmbH, the leading
provider of realtime Java technology for embedded system.
Educated at Yale, Boston University, and the University of Karlsruhe,
he has worked in diverse projects such as restructurable wafer
scale integrated circuits (RVLSI), parallel Lisp, software standards,
and realtime Java. He is the specification lead for the Real-
Time Specification for Java (JSR-282). He was also European Cochair
for the subgroup on object-oriented technology of the SC-205 Plenary for
updating software safety standard for avionics, resulting in the
Object Oriented and
Related Technology Supplement now published as DO-332 and ED-217.
He joined the OSGi Alliance to bring realtime to OSGi.


Christian Schneider
~~~~~~~
Christian is a computer scientist working at Adobe on the
Adobe Experience Manager Platform team. On the open source side he
is involved with quite a few Apache open source projects like
Felix, Karaf, CXF, Camel. Christian is interested in clean code,
software architecture and modular software design.

BJ Hargrave
~~~~~~~
BJ Hargrave is CTO of the OSGi Alliance and chair of the
OSGi Core Platform Expert Group.  His day job is as Saenior Technical
Staff Member in the IBM Digital Business Group. BJ has led the
development of OSGi technology since its inception and is currently
He is also a committer on the Eclipse Equinox project and the Bndtools project.

Thema bzw. Themen
-----------------

OSGi and Java 9+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: BJ Hargrave

Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) as a
way to modularize the Java platform and it can be also be
used by developers to modularize their own applications,
although JPMS lack a number of important features for
software running on the Java platform.

As people look to support the latest versions of the Java platform,
changes introduced in Java 9 related to JPMS led to the needs for
some features in the OSGi Core specification. OSGi framework
implementations like Eclipse Equinox and Apache Felix and tools
like Bnd were updated to support these new features.

Fit for the Edge: Making OSGi Robuster and Realtime Capable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Dr James Blunt

OSGi brings many benefits, but it lacks two important features
for Industry 4.0: strong bundle isolation and the ability
to provide realtime guarantees.  The Realtime Specification
for Java 2.0 provides the basis for filling this gap.
It provides both APIs and JVM semantic refinements for
realtime programming and resource management.  Marrying these
features to OSGi will make OSGi the leading platform for
edge computing.


Popular patterns revisited on OSGi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Christian Schneider

We will look at common cloud and design patterns and see
how the special properties of the OSGi environment allow
us to rethink these patterns. The talk shows some well-known
patterns like the service registry and the whiteboard but
also some unique patterns like out of band circuit breaker
or graceful degregation. The patterns are shown with some
examples using declarative services(DS). So some basic OSGi
and DS knowledge is of advantage but not required.

For OSGi beginners, the well established OSGi patterns will
help getting started the right way. Experienced OSGi developers
will find some new patterns to think about. Cloud or enterprise
developers will get a new approach to some patterns they are
used to which hopefully inspires them to take another look at
the current state of OSGi.
