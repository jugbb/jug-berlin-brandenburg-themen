Thema bzw. Themen

Raspberry Pi with Java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Stephen Chin

In this session I will walk you through how to build your own retro handheld
console that is powered by Java, runs on a Raspberry Pi, and is printed on a
3D printer.  Some of the topics that we will cover along the journey include:

- Hacking Java on the Raspberry Pi
- Rigging input devices with Pi4J
- Insane performance tuning on the JVM
- Why your boss [or SO] needs to buy you a 3D printer!

And of course your retro gaming mettle will be put to the test, so make sure to
dust off your old 8 and 16 bit consoles to prepare.

This presentation is about the most fun you can have while still legitimately calling
this conference “work.”  In fact, I will hopefully inspire you to do your own
creative “work” leveraging Java and Raspberry Pi to hack the real world.

Putting Hypermedia Back in REST with JAX-RS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Sebastian Daschner

Everybody is doing REST -- at least everybody claims they are. But mostly web APIs
are built without Hypermedia, what would allow the client to follow
related resources and autonomously navigate through the API without
prior implicit logic of the application. This sessions shows the concept
and benefits of a Hypermedia driven REST API and how to
implement this using JavaEE 7 with JAX-RS.

In this session I will give an introduction for RESTful web services
with Hypermedia as the engine of application state, what the benefits
and costs of using this approach are and show different approaches
how to realize such REST services with JavaEE 7 and JAX-RS.
Most of the time will be spend demonstrating different implementations (
plain JavaEE 7, existing libraries, etc.) with live coding.
The session is held in English.
