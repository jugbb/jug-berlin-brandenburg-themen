Hazelcast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Greg Luck

Hazelcast is an open source, operational in-memory computing platform built
on the JVM that helps leading companies worldwide bring their existing
applications into the age of web scale and cloud computing. At its core
is an elastic, self-balancing, self-healing cluster of highly-available,
distributed computing and memory servers that provide fast, reliable
access to scalable in-memory data for applications.

Use familiar data structures like maps, lists, and queues as well as
standard interfaces like ExecutorService, MapReduce, JCache, and
Memcache. Hazelcast works with Java as well as a host of other languages
including C, C++, .NET and any platform with a memcache or REST client.

With Hazelcast, you can easily speed up a single application or use it
as a centralized, enterprise-wide utility to:

- Seamlessly share terabytes of in-memory data between many applications
- Create multi-application processes that operate faster and more fluidly
  than with traditional databases - Easily share computational execution
  among applications, and scale to hundreds of cores to achieve massive economies
  of scale - whether onsite, virtualized, Docker, or cloud

This hands-on talk will enable you to get started exploring Hazelcast
and give your project a jump start in application speed and scale.
