Top Java Performance Mistakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Andreas Grabner

Have you ever wondered why your e-Banking system is down yet 
again for maintenance or what problem it was that caused your 
check-out to take forever until it terminatqed with a weird error message?
Misconfigured O/R Mappers causing millions of SQL Queries and "leaking" DB 
connection leaks, excessive logging that consumes all Disk I/O, memory 
leaks that bring the JVM to crash every couple of hours or a forgotten XML 
configuration entry that causes millions of "Control-Flow Exceptions" that 
never make it to any log file. These are some of the problems that crashed 
large enterprise applications in the last 12 years (some even made it to 
national & international news). In this session we learn how to avoid 
these top problems by automatically looking at key performance and 
architectural metrics along your continuous deployment pipeline.
