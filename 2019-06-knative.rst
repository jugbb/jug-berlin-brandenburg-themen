Introduction to Knative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Sprecher**: Matthias Wessendorf

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform that comes with a set of building
blocks to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.
Knative consists of three major areas: Build, Serving and Eventing.
The session gives you an introduction of the different parts of Knative
and walks you through an end-to-end demo, showing the lifecycle of an
event-driven application. You will learn how to build container images
inside your cluster, straight from your Git repository. The session
explains how Knative uses Kubernetes and Istio features to provide
request driven compute, so that services can autoscale, including
down to 0, depending on the actual throughput. Finally you'll see
integration of events and how your application can be hooked up to a
firehose and connect your service to process incoming events. If you
are interested in learning about serverless developer experience on
Kubernetes, this session is for you!

Developing and running Kafka based applications on Kubernetes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Jakub Scholz**

Apache Kafka is one of the most popular platforms for streaming and
messaging. This talk will show how easy it is to deploy and use
Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and OpenShift using the open source
project called Strimzi. Kubernetes operators provided by Strimzi
let users deploy Apache Kafka with just few YAML files. It will
also demonstrate how you can easily connect to Kafka and Strimzi
from your own applications in a secure fashion using authentication
and authorisation. The demo used during this talk will include
several applications using different Apache Kafka components such
as Kafka Connect or Kafka Streams and demonstrate the architecture
patterns commonly used with Apache Kafka.
